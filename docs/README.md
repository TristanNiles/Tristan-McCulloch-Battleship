# 448-Project1
This is a Battleship project for EECS 448.
It is written primarily in JavaScript.<br/>
This project was given to me (Tristan McCulloch) and 3 other students to add functionality to a simple battleship game initially made by another group of 4.
The primary contributions of mine were the medium AI, the layout, the art, and the majority of the CSS.
